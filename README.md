# Ruby Koans Practice
This repo is just for saving my practice with Ruby Koans. I wanted a way to look
back on the changes I did, and to leave notes to myself so that I can speed up
my Ruby learning as fast as possible. You're welcome to read through it too,
because maybe it'll help you with your own Ruby learning.

View the RUBYKOANS_README.rdoc for the original README to the project.
